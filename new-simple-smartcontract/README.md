 ### Aiken v1.1.6 Dmart Contract Deployment
 
 last update in October 2023, 
 Aiken-lang is a programming language designed for writing smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain. 
## I will provide a simple example of a smart contract written in Aiken-lang version 1.1.6, along with instructions on how to deploy it.

## Deployment Steps
Create a New Aiken Project: If you haven't already, create a new directory for your Aiken project and navigate into it.

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
mkdir SimpleStorageProject
cd SimpleStorageProject
Create the Smart Contract File: Create a new file named SimpleStorage.aiken and paste the smart contract code into it.

Compile the Smart Contract: Use the Aiken CLI to compile your smart contract.

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
aiken compile SimpleStorage.aiken
This will generate a .mv file (Move bytecode) in the out directory.

Deploy the Smart Contract: Use the Aptos CLI to deploy the compiled contract. You will need to specify the path to the compiled .mv file and the account you want to deploy from.
...
aptos move publish --package-dir out --account <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Replace <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> with your actual Aptos account address.
...
Verify Deployment: After deploying, you can verify that your contract is deployed by checking the Aptos Explorer or using the Aptos CLI to query the contract.

Interacting with the Smart Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the SimpleStorage contract using the Aptos CLI or through a front-end application. Hereâ€™s how you can call the functions:

Set a Value:
...
aptos move call --function set --args <VALUE> --account <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Replace <VALUE> with the integer you want to store.
...
Get the Value:
...
aptos move call --function get --account <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
